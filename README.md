# dotfiles

After cloning run `./install` to install home directory dotfiles.
To install system files run `./install_system` and to install yaourt packages run `./install_packages`.

Changes can be made in `install.conf.yaml`, `system.conf.yaml` and `packages.conf.yaml`.

These dotfiles are still under development and not complete yet.
